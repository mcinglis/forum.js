Forum.js is a basic forum server based on [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com). There's probably already a project called forum.js, but whatevs.

This was inspired by [fwielstra's gist](https://gist.github.com/fwielstra/1025038) of the same theme. I've just forked that, cleaned it up (IMHO), and added some functionality.

So, currently, this is just an improved demo of Express and Mongoose. In future, I might flesh it out a bit more, which is why I made a repository for this.
